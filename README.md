## Project Overview  
This project involved: designing tables to hold data from CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answering questions about the data. Essentially, performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
---
## Data Modeling:  
To model the data, I first inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, I used a free tool called QuickDBD.
---
## Data Engineering:
To perform the data engineering, I used the provided information (from the learning module along with the CSV files) to create a table schema for each of the six provided CSV files. Creating the schema involved specifying the data type(s) and creating the primary and foreign keys for each table.
After creating the tables, I then importd the data from the CSV files into their respective table(s).
---
## Data Analysis:
To perform the data analysis, a series of queries was executed on the database to collect the desired information from each of the tables.
---
## Conclusions:  
This excercise allowed me to gain a further understanding of SQL, specifically, how it can be used to engineer and analyze data.
